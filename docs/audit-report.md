# FoodSyriaApp - Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive audit report documents the security, performance, and architectural analysis of the FoodSyriaApp project. The audit was conducted to identify vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and areas for improvement. All critical issues have been addressed, and the project is now in a stable and secure state.

## Audit Scope

- **Codebase Analysis**: Full review of TypeScript, React, and Next.js code
- **Security Assessment**: Vulnerability scanning and credential management
- **Database Analysis**: Schema review and connection optimization
- **API Security**: Endpoint authentication and authorization checks
- **Performance Evaluation**: Loading times and resource usage analysis
- **Architecture Review**: System design and component structure

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Mixed Authentication Systems üö® **FIXED**

**Issue**: The project was running both NextAuth.js and Supabase Auth simultaneously, causing conflicts and authentication failures.

**Impact**: Users could not log in properly, session management was unreliable.

**Solution**: 
- Migrated all API endpoints from NextAuth to Supabase Auth
- Updated authentication context to use Supabase SSR
- Fixed middleware to use Supabase sessions
- Removed NextAuth dependencies from protected routes

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/reservations/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/orders/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/reviews/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/notifications/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/loyalty/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/payment/create-intent/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/notifications/[id]/read/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/loyalty/redeem/route.ts`
- `src/middleware.ts`

### 2. Hardcoded Credentials Exposure üö® **FIXED**

**Issue**: Database passwords and API keys were hardcoded in multiple files and exposed in documentation.

**Impact**: Critical security vulnerability allowing unauthorized database access.

**Solution**:
- Moved database password to environment variable `DB_PASSWORD`
- Updated `.env` and `.env.local` files to use variable substitution
- Removed hardcoded credentials from documentation files
- Added comments indicating legacy NextAuth configuration for future cleanup

**Files Modified**:
- `.env`
- `.env.local`

### 3. Port Conflicts and Process Management üö® **FIXED**

**Issue**: Multiple Node.js processes running on port 3000 causing "EADDRINUSE" errors.

**Impact**: Development server instability and application crashes.

**Solution**:
- Identified and terminated duplicate processes
- Cleaned up process management
- Ensured single instance development server
